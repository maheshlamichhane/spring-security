Basic authentication working mechanism:-> when client first request comes in,
the request will be intercepted by filter security interceptor then it will start looking
for authorization basic header beacouse we have configured our security here.means it start
from the confugure method with HttpSecurity parameter.since client did not send any 
authentication basic scheme,so it will throw an exception.it will throw access denied exception
.once the access denied exception is thrown,the control will come to our authentication entry
point.then our authentication entry point will come into picture then commense method will
be invoked then response will came back to client with 401 status.then client send request 
with basic authorization header.so once again when the request comes to our api it will be
intercepted by the FSI(Filter Security Interceptor) this time basic authorization header
is present.once it find basic authorization header is present then it will invoke the basic
authentication filter it will not throw exception beacourse header are present.the BAF(basic
authentication filter) will do it will be base64 decode the authorization header.once decode
is done then it will create a username ,password authentication token.it will have the user
name,and the password.once it has created the username and password token,the control will go 
to the authentication manager.authentication manager will invoke our user,so authentication 
will invoke our user details service,whatever userDetailsService we have created.this will
invoke loadUserByUsername method will be invoke. this method get the username which has been
set in the token.this method will return the UserDetails class object.
if UserDetail Object contain the user then connection will be successful.request is send back
to the user.if password is not match then 401 response is sent back to the user or user not 
found exception.
