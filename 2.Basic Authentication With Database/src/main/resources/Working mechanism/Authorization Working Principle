Authorization Working Principle:-Authorization means Restricting unauthorize access of data/
resource which means providing permission for do something like accessing the particular url.
In spring security we have something called granted authority.granted authority are high
level permission that the user is granted few examples can be roles and scopes.Granted 
authority can be obtained from the users details class and the authentication that authorities
method as well.

In User class we are implementing UserDetails Class.in this spring class there is one method
called GrantedAuthority.this authority is supposed to return a collection of granted
authorities.In this Granted Authority,you will see that this is an interface where it is just 
returning getAuthority().Granted authority is an authority what is granted to a principle
or user.these authorities can be roles,administrator,user,supervisor.thes roles are used
for authorizing the action.Other parts of spring security are also capable of interpreting
these authorities and they expect them to be present that's why we implement method in user 
class.


we will use a particular implementation of granted authorities,which is simple granted 
authority.
